            Factories and manufacturing plants operate with constant machinery,
            production lines, presses, and automated systems that expose employees
            to prolonged high noise levels. Without regular monitoring, this
            exposure can lead to permanent noise-induced hearing loss and legal
            risk for employers.

            Our industrial hearing screening service for factories is designed to
            help manufacturers protect employees, meet UK health &amp; safety
            requirements, and maintain a safe, productive workplace.
